Hello,\r\n

I am Zachary Q. Whiting. I am a full-stack web developer certified in the MERN stack, and I am looking for a full-time position. I am also a musician, writer, philosopher, theologist, and husband.\r\n

I was born and raised in West Jordan, Utah, to two loving parents. My personality as a child was energetic and intelligent, but I was socially untaught. My biggest redeeming qualities were my intellect and my desire to do good, though they both turned out to be double-edged. Being a sensitive and purpose-driven child, my inability to make meaningful connections and what I perceived as the lack of any real purpose in the world of children traumatized me.\r\n

Come highschool, and I was consumed by fear and hopelessness, believing that nothing mattered and all people were fake. I was hospitalized and diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, which led me to drop out in my senior year. I got my GED with high marks the following fall, and over the next few years I worked off and on in offices and food service, but I spent most of my time exploring the fictional worlds of Asia through their unique visual and written media. Ironically, during this time of little educational progression, I learned a great deal about life, death, and love, all of which pushed me towards the light of understanding.\r\n

When I was 24, I recovered enough to move forward and advance my education. Being enamoured with fiction, I started out slowly by taking a single class on creative writing. It was very rewarding. I discovered that over the years, I had inadvertently developed a talent in language and writing, and so I became a writer and artist.\r\n

In my second semester, I met my wife. We became best friends in a short amount of time, but we kept ourselves romantically distant until we were sure that such a relationship would be beneficial and not destructive. Then, suddenly and unexpectedly, the theoretical ponderings about love we had growing up became our reality.\r\n

We began to connect on deeper levels and began to develop each other's mental healths, with psychology, philosophy and religion as our teachers and pure love as the goal. It's been a gripping journey becoming her partner, and it feels like we've only barely began to address the concerns of life, but we are also astounded at how far we have progressed. Either way, navigating through life together has been the greatest joy, and as newleyweds, the buds of new life bloom at our feet. For the first time in my own life, I have real purpose and real motivation. I cannot describe how liberating it is to truely connect to someone on a foundational level, believing that everything has meaning and everything is real, when previously, all was darkness.\r\n

One of the many concerns before we were married, however, was my career plan, as writing wouldn't be a reliable income any time soon. During my search, I stumbled across the University of Utah Online Coding Bootcamp. Actually, I was pretty hesitant about it at first. I didn't grow up dreaming about designing webpages or apps, and I knew almost nothing about coding. The online tutorials where I created shapes and moved them around with exact pixel measurements were also dreadfully inefficient. But the short six-month intensive program and the potential career I could have afterwards were enough to motivate me to apply.\r\n

I took to coding much like I took to writing: I discovered that I was already equipped to learn it quickly, and I found enjoyment in learning the intricate rules, methods, and syntaxes and piecing them together to create a functional composition. I find it a treat to take a design or a need and turn it into a useful and comfortable tool to benefit the involved parties. I've even made a rudementary philosophy stating that the various containers and methods in programming are typical of (or parallel) basic human activity and behavior, which has helped me visualize improvements in my own beliefs and behaviors. Although I've yet to completely connect programming to the essential purpose that drives me, I do not hesitate anymore to say that web development has become an exciting career choice, and I expect great things to come from it.\r\n

The University of Utah's bootcamp proved instrumental in teaching me all the required knowledge for programming. I am now proficient in creating full-stack applications using popular methods and technologies while adhering to best practices, and I can also make design decisions in each of the model, view, and controller aspects of web development, amongst many other skills. Of course, there's always more that I don't know—as is the nature of life—but I now have a solid foundation to branch out from as I am faced with new problems and challenges.\r\n

My next goal is to find a job where I can use the skills I have obtained through the University's bootcamp to support my family's growth. Until then, programming is largely an activity of personal development that I balance alongside my writing. Long term, I hope to contribute to the healthy growth of children using programming as one of my teaching tools. I am determined to increase my knowledge and experience in programming in order to acheive these goals.\r\n

If you are looking to hire, I ask that you consider me and create a meaningful impact in my life. Please help yourself to my portfolio and send me any inquiries you may have. I'd love to answer any questions or set up a time for an interview.\r\n

Thank you for your interest,\r\n
Zachary Q. Whiting
