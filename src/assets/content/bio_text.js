Hello,\r\n

I am Zachary Q. Whiting, full-stack web developer specializing in the MERN stack.
I have 1000+ hours of coding experience across all stages of web development, an attention to detail,
and a proven ability to quickly learn new programming languages and APIs.
I am currently seeking a full-time 100%-remote position, but I am also open to other forms of remote work.\r\n

I've both created and collaborated on over thirty web programs which include everything
from pure html websites to highly scalable websites using template engines, mostly React.
I've trained to use many different methodologies including Object Oriented Programming,
Functional Programming, Test Driven Development, Mobile-First Responsiveness, Representational State Transfer,
and Agile Development, and I've used these methods to create PWAs, CMS blogs, e-commerce sites,
search engines, APIs, file generators, and more.\r\n

Design wise, all my apps use modern CSS3 and/or SCSS with features such as flexbox and grid or a
CSS framework like Bootstrap, and I have implemented wireframes as well as created my own original designs.
In the back end, I have experience with both SQL and NoSQL servers
and have built authentication, RESTful, and GraphQL services.\r\n

I believe that vision and organization are the key components a project needs to determine success.
As an aspiring novelist, I've trained to place these values at the forefront of my attention.
Transferring my skills over to computer coding has only deepened my appreciation of their value, and I'm
very much looking forward to expanding my abilities even more in the collaborative setting of web development.\r\n

I am eager to learn and grow, not only as a developer, but also as a person,
and I am positive that I am prepared to exceed any standards as a junior developer.\r\n
