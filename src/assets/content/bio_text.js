I am Zachary Quinn Whiting—writer, artist, philosopher, and full-stack web developer—but mostly just a man. Here is my story:\r\n

Born and raised in Utah by parents who provided all that they could, I grew up as a sober yet distanced child. I thought more for the welfare of those around me than myself, but I didn't have the wisdom to actually do any good. Instead, I was repressed and consumed by fear and hopelessness.\r\n

In highschool, I was hospitalized and diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, which led me to drop out in my senior year. I got my GED with high marks the following fall. I worked off and on during the next few years, but I spent most of my time exploring the fictional worlds of Asia through their unique visual and written media. Ironically, during this time of very little temporal progression, I actually learned an exceptional amount about life, death, and love—much more than I have any right to at my age.\r\n

I recovered enough to move forward with my own life when I was 24 years of age, which happened by attending my first semester of college. I started out slowly by taking only one class on creative writing. It was very rewarding. I discovered that, partially because of my years of consuming large amounts of such, I had inadvertently developed a talent in language and writing, and so I became a writer and artist.\r\n

In my second semester, I met the love of my life. We connected on an inordinately foundational level and began to develop eachother's psycologies. The theoretical ponderings we both had while growing up suddenly became our reality. We entered into our roots and were watered by our testimonies, and now as newleyweds, the buds of life bloom at our feet.\r\n

A little more than a year after we met, (and after my sudden return from a full-time mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints due to covid), I decided to figure out my career plans. As I was doing so, I stumbled across the University of Utah Online Coding Bootcamp. I was hesitant about applying at first. I didn't grow up dreaming about designing webpages and apps; I actually knew almost nothing about coding. But the six-month intensive program and the potential career I could have afterwards were enough to motivate me to apply.\r\n

I took to coding like I took to writing. I found that my brain was already equipped to learn it quickly, and I progressed at a fast pace. I really enjoy learning the intricate rules, methods, and syntaxes and piecing them together to create a functional composition. I've even created a rudementary philosophy stating that the containers and methods used in programming are parallels to basic human nature and activity. Now, after almost six months of the University's intensive program and three months of self-study, I have learned the ins and outs of webdesign, and I am able to create full-stack applications using popular methods and technologies, mainly with the MERN stack. Of course, there's always more that I don't know than I do (as is the nature of life), but I now have a solid foundation to branch out from as I am faced with new problems and challenges.\r\n

My next goal is to find a job where I can use the skills I have obtained though the University's bootcamp. After that, I hope to steer myself towards childhood development and to start a family with my wife. Ultimately, we hope to live charitable lives.\r\n

Much is unknown about the future, and my story is mostly untold, but I thank you for reading this small piece, and I'd love to see if we could work together.
