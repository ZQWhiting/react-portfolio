Here is my story:\r\n\n\nBorn and raised in Utah by parents who provided all that they could, I grew up as a sober yet distanced child. I thought more for the welfare of those around me than myself, but I didn't have the wisdom to actually do any good. Instead, I was repressed and consumed by fear and hopelessness.\r\n\n\nIn highschool, I was hospitalized and diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, which led me to drop out in my senior year. I got my GED the following fall. I worked off and on during the next few years, but I spent most of my time exploring the fictional worlds of Asia through their unique visual and written media. Ironically, during this time of very little temporal progression, I actually learned an exceptional amount about life, death and love\u2014much more than I have any right to at my age.\r\n\n\nI recovered enough to move forward with my own life when I was 24 years of age, which happened by attending my first semester of college. I started out slowly by taking only one class on creative writing. It was very rewarding. I discovered that, because of my years of pure consumption of such, I had inadvertently developed a talent in language and writing, and so I became a writer and artist.\r\n\n\nIn my second semester, I met the love of my life. We connected on an inordinately foundational level and began to develop eachother's psycologies. The theoretical ponderings we both had while growing up suddenly became our reality. We entered into our roots and were watered by our testimonies, and now the buds of wisdom bloom at our feet.\r\n\n\nA little more than a year later, after I came back home from a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints cut short by COVID, I decided to figure out my career plans. As I was doing so, I stumbled across the University of Utah Online Coding Bootcamp. I was hesitant about it at first. I didn't grow up dreaming about designing webpages and apps; I actually knew almost nothing about coding. But the six-month intensive program and the potential career I could have afterwards were enough to motivate me to apply.\r\n\n\nI took to coding like I took to writing. I found that my brain was already wired to learn it, and I progressed at a breakneck speed. I really enjoy learning the intricate rules, methods, and syntaxes and piecing them together to create a functional composition. After almost six months of the University's intensive program, I have learned the ins and outs of webdesign, and I am able to create full-stack applications using popular methods and technologies, such as the MERN stack, amongst other skills. Of course, there's always more that I don't know than I do (as is the nature of life), but I now have a solid foundation to branch out from as I am faced with new problems and challenges.\r\n\n\nMy next goal is to find a job where I can use the skills I have obtained though the University's bootcamp, hopefully before my love and I are married this coming winter. After that, I hope to steer myself towards childhood development and to start a family. Then, my future wife and I hope to live charitable lives.\r\n\n\nMuch is unknown about the future, and my story is mostly untold, but I thank you for reading this small piece.\n";a(37);var y=function(){return o.a.createElement("section",null,o.a.createElement("h1",null,"About me"),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"photo frame"},o.a.createElement("img",{src:b.a,alt:"Zachary Q.
